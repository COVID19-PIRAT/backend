# Backend service

This is my personal fork of the backend service, programmed for the "wirvsvirus" Hackathon.
I use this fork mainly to demonstrate and implement a CI-Pipeline using Github, Actions and DockerHub

You can find the original repository, along with its original README on the projects Github: https://github.com/COVID19-PIRAT/backend
